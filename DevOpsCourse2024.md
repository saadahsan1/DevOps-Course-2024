# DevOps-Tooling
I basically ran a super linter GitHub actions workflow.
I created my own file and create my own workflow in YAML format.
The workflow functions is as follows:
  1. Sets up a job
  2. Pulls super linter repo's from the internet
  3. Checks out the code
  4. Cleans the job.

Summary of the last two blogs
Blog 1 : Web Assembly (Wasm)

WebAssembly represents a significant leap forward in web development, enabling developers to achieve near-native performance within the browser. By overcoming the limitations of JavaScript and providing a platform-agnostic, secure environment, Wasm opens the door to a wide range of high-performance applications — everything from gaming and video editing to machine learning and complex computational tasks.

Blog 2 : Creating an EKS Cluster using Terraform

Terraform is extremely excellent for reusability of the resources for cloud. It’s also ideal for state management purposes and keeping track of the changes made to the configuration. Terraform is relatively a new technology and its future is uncertain as it’s other flavor ‘Pulumi’ is said to advance in a much higher level.

# My learning
I learned a lot in this course. Mainly the upcoming technologies in the IT field. I learned about Kubernetes, Terraform, Github actions,
EKS clusters, wrote 2 blogs and much more especially non-technoical information.
My contribution to this course was writing 2 blogs on Wasm and Creating an EKS Cluster through Teraform and writing my own Super Linter Github Actions workflow file.
